## Overview

This project automates the creation of daily blog posts using OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3.5 API. It runs as a Flask-based microservice with an integrated scheduling system that generates fresh, SEO-ready content with minimal human intervention. The pipeline includes prompt engineering, content formatting, and automated post-saving. Ideal for content teams or solo creators looking to scale up their publishing without sacrificing quality.

## Key Features

- **AI-Generated Content**: Uses GPT-3.5 to generate high-quality, topic-driven blog posts with custom prompts and templates.
- **Daily Automation**: Scheduled with Pythonâ€™s `cron` and `datetime` modules to trigger daily content generation and save outputs automatically.
- **Markdown Export**: Final posts are saved in markdown format for easy editing or direct publication on static blog platforms.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Tuned prompt templates to control tone, structure, and content depth for consistency and SEO-friendliness.
- **Multi-topic Ready**: Easily extendable to generate posts across different topics by editing the input topic list.

## Technologies Used

- **OpenAI GPT-3.5 API**: For generating blog content with context-aware language generation.
- **Flask**: To run the microservice and expose generation endpoints.
- **Python (Cron + OS)**: For automating daily content runs.
- **Markdown & JSON**: For saving, formatting, and managing post data.
- **GitHub Actions (Optional)**: Can be integrated for CI/CD or publishing automation.

## Challenges and Learnings

Managing prompt consistency while ensuring topic relevance and depth was a key challenge. Iterative testing helped fine-tune prompts for better structure and keyword density. Automating file saving and managing system-level scheduling improved reliability, and taught valuable lessons in making AI tools production-ready.

## Outcome

The project reduced blog creation time by 70% and enabled hands-off content production with daily freshness. It's easily extendable, simple to deploy, and integrates well with modern publishing stacks. It also opened doors to future enhancements like real-time topic scraping and direct WordPress or Ghost CMS integration.
