## 🧬 Overview

This project simulates and models outcomes of **induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) differentiation** protocols using machine learning. The primary outcome predicted is **Purity**, a key metric representing how successfully stem cells have converted into target lineages.

The project uses **synthetic, biologically inspired datasets** and multiple ML models (regression and deep learning) to evaluate how well different modeling techniques can predict experimental success.

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Synthetic Dataset Simulation**  
  Generated realistic cytokine concentrations, culture parameters (like O₂ %, seeding density), and gene expression profiles from known stem cell markers (e.g., SOX2, NANOG).

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Used correlation heatmaps, outlier checks, and distribution analysis to understand feature relationships and detect experimental constraints.

- **Modeling Multiple Algorithms**  
  Trained and compared:
  - Linear Regression
  - XGBoost
  - Random Forest
  - MLP Neural Network
  - TabNet (deep learning on tabular data)

- **Performance Comparison**  
  Used R², MAE, and RMSE metrics to benchmark models. Random Forest achieved the best overall performance.

- **Interactive Streamlit App**  
  Created a dashboard where users can simulate their protocol and get predicted purity in real-time.

## 🧠 Challenges & Learnings

Simulating biologically reasonable protocols required domain knowledge to constrain ranges (e.g., realistic BMP4 doses). Deep models like TabNet required careful tuning and early stopping to perform competitively on small data.

**Comparison between classical models and deep learning** taught valuable trade-offs:
- Simpler models like Random Forest performed best due to dataset size and structure.
- TabNet needed tuning but offered interpretability potential.
- Neural nets (MLP) were highly sensitive to scale and data volume.

This hands-on project strengthened my applied ML skills in real-world biological problems and helped bridge the gap between **wet lab protocol simulation** and **computational prediction.**

## 📊 Outcome

- XGBoost — R²: 0.8438, MAE: 1.8502, RMSE: 2.0940

- Random Forest — R²: 0.8718, MAE: 1.5575, RMSE: 1.8968

- MLP (Neural Net) — R²: 0.4996, MAE: 3.3232, RMSE: 3.7478

- TabNet (Optimized) — R²: 0.8622, MAE: 1.5711, RMSE: 1.9670

Random Forest delivered the most consistent results, while TabNet showed strong potential with tuning. This comparison demonstrated the **importance of aligning model complexity with data availability** and problem goals.
